# Persona-Humanoid-Robot
In this product the basic idea is the techniques which are used in human-human interaction, they can be used as an initiative for human-robot interaction.

Probelem-statement 
One of the major issues faced by large institutes, such as universities, is the difficulty in locating specific offices or obtaining necessary information in a timely manner. The lack of insightful resources further complicates the issue

Proposed solution
we propose the developmentof a humanoid robot capable of providing comprehensive information on various aspects of the organization, including but not limited to, the locations of offices, labs, sports facilities, and hostels, academic curricula, eligibility criteria for scholarships, and professor details. The robotwill be designed to provide formal greetings and expressions to create a professional
environment. Additionally, the robot will serve as a one-stop-shop for obtaining pertinent information related to the organization, making it easier for individuals to navigate and access necessary resources. In doing so, the humanoid robot will provide an efficient and effective solution to a longstanding problem that has hindered the productivity of large institutions.

Solution approach
Our team decided to utilize 3D printing technology to construct the robot's body, ensuring that it is lightweight and durable. We also incorporated advanced sensors such as cameras, microphones, and speakers into the design, which will allow the robot to receive and process voice inputs effectively.To achieve this, we will integrate these sensors into a program that is trained using machine learning techniques. Additionally, we will leverage the power of artificial intelligence to further enhance the accuracy of the robot's responses. To enable seamless communication between the different components, we will utilize an array of hardware components including Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Node MCU, and a WiFi module.
